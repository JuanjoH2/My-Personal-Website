Life is like a beautiful painting.<br>
When you are working on it, you are focused solely on the thing you are currently painting.<br>
It can be a cozy house, a big tree, or a beautiful woman.<br>
But every now and then, you must stop painting, give three steps back, and look at the big picture. So you know where you are now, and where you are going.
