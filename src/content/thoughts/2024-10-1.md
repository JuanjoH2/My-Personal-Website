Most self-development habits grow like bamboo.<br>
At the beginning, it’s easy to think that nothing is happening. That you are just watering a useless seed. But what we don’t realize is that during the first long stage, the bamboo – like habits – grows strong roots. But they’re hardly noticeable.<br>
But after years of watering and caring for your bamboo (habits), it fastly grows to more than 40 meters high in just a few weeks.
