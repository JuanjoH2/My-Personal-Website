When those moments arise. When you think that *that* specific girl is the only one that exists, remember all those times when you felt that way before. And also remember how you felt after meeting and talking to other girls. This ain’t the last girl in the world. There are plenty of other amazing women in your future. So, don’t sweat it! Just keep being your best version of yourself you’re capable of being right now, and enjoy the ride!<br>
Do not pretend to be somebody else and do not think that if this doesn’t work, you are never going to find another one. Because you will at some point.

And if you continue to improve and develop yourself, every time that you meet another great woman, you will be able to experience her better (fuller and deeper). And of course, developed people attract developed people. So, it’s very probable that you are going to continue meeting amazing people.

You are going to meet different women. And what makes them special: their unicity that it’s up to you to discover. And thanks to your development, you will be able to achieve this. You will be able to experience them deeper. Without judgements. Seeing them as they truly are. And of course, you will be able to share yourself that way too. Authentically, deeper, and fuller. Without fears and without caring the unnecessary weight of idolising the other person. Or trying to impress her by being perfect. Trying to find “the perfect words to use”, or “the perfect date”. Because that doesn’t exist. That will be only limiting yourself to perform at your best performance (showing yourself as you are), and to be at peace.

Be at peace with yourself. You know you are enough. You know you are great as you are, but are willing to be better. Just be your authentic and best self. And enjoy the ride!

A lot of women are going to pass by. If they’re friends, well, the more the merrier. Because you are going to be surrounding yourself with amazing people.
And when the time comes for you to start a romantic relationship, it will naturally occur. It will happen organically. And by this, I mean that both of you will be attracted to each other (physically, mentally, and spiritually). Both of you are going to be willing to try things out. Both of you are going to say “yes” to each other.<br>
And you don’t need to be seeking a “yes” from everybody. You just have to be your best self with everybody, and try to offer the best friendship you’re capable of being. And when the time comes, it will happen.<br>
And when the time comes, of course, be open to share your feelings with the other person. And if the other person feels that way too and is willing, well, that’s great!

But for the moment, focus on what you can control. Focus on being your best self.
