I came up with this concept as a necessity of having a default useful thing to do whenever I feel oddly bored or slouchy. You know, that feeling of not having something precisely urgent to do, but at the same time, a foggy boredom wanting you to do the easier stuff – like playing video games, watching YouTube videos, or doing dumb stuff that doesn’t really move the needle –.<br>
Defaulting is setting beforehand a list of things you would like to default to whenever you feel slouchy. This often is aligned with the things you want to be making progress at.<br>
For me, this actually is reflected in reading, writing cards to my friends, or taking my piano lessons.
This is useful for me. Because now when I feel slouchy, I know precisely where to **default** myself at.
