There's a programming concept that I think applies to life too.

In life, when we’re facing obstacles (opportunities for growth) that appear to be impossible to achieve. Just break it down into small and manageable tasks.<br>
And if those tasks also appear to be impossible, break those down too, until you reach a point where it just becomes “placing a brick on top of the other in order to build a world-class building”.
