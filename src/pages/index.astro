    "We’ve all been there. We set a goal for ourselves, we get excited, we create a strategy (sometimes), and we start doing it. But a few weeks pass by, and life happens. We don’t achieve it, and disappointment kicks-in. Does this sound familiar? Apparently this is the story that many of my friends and I share in common. But what if I tell you that we can become invulnerable to disappointment? And the answer, my friend, lies in the very definition of disappointment: [disappointment is the] “sadness or displeasure caused by the nonfulfillment of one's hopes or expectations” (Oxford Languages) Let’s just focus on the highlighted part: “nonfulfillment of one’s hopes or expectations”. And add a pinch of stoicism. Since disappointment is triggered by the nonfulfillment of our own hopes or expectations, it’s logical to think that if we, somehow, find a way to make all our hopes and expectations achievable for us, we will rarely find ourselves in a place of disappointment, right? Well, here’s when I want to introduce to you one of the main stoic pillars: the Dichotomy of Control. Which basically is to distinguish between the things that are in our control, and the things that aren’t. So that we can focus on the things we can control, and let go of the things we don’t. And with this, we free ourselves a lot of energy to do what really matters in our life, and to really move the needle (and as you may have guessed, free us from disappointment). Picture this: You just met a great new girl (or guy) you find very attractive. You both talk for a bit and you ask for her phone number. She gives it to you, and you start a great relationship. You start to go out together, and things are going great. Now, here’s where it gets interesting. Let’s propose two scenarios: Scenario A: You begin to create illusions and stories in your head about how great your relationship is going to be, you begin to fantasize with the idea that she feels the same way too, and a snowball of hopes and expectations starts to build up. You’re unconsciously placing your own peace into something you cannot control at all: another person’s feelings and/or decisions...";
